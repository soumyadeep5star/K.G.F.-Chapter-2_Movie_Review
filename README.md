# K.G.F.-Chapter-2_Movie_Review
In this notebook the User Review of the movie KGF Chapter-2 in the IMDb website is used to train the classification model for classifying whether the review is negative ,neutral or positive.The data that is to be trained undergoes various stages of NLP , removing html from the text , removing punctuation,tokenizing,stemming etc..Here Naive Bayes Classifier ,Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier are used for training the model.
I have used Octoparse tool for webscarping the IMDb data.
